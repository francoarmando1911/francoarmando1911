     <br>
    <br>

My name is Franco Armando, I am a student of the University Technician in Programming at UTN 

I deeply enjoy studying programming, especially the Java language and its related technologies, through a self-taught approach. My areas of knowledge include Java (POO), Spring Boot, Maven, Python, Django, HTTP-REST and relational databases such as MySQL.

I am always looking to learn and apply design patterns such as DAO, Factory and Builder to improve application development.

I consider myself a responsible, hard-working and constant person, with a strong desire to expand my knowledge. I have the ability to quickly adapt to new situations and challenges, which allows me to interact comfortably with people of different levels and backgrounds.
